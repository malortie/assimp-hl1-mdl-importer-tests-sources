 # Compiling models.
 
 A working version of StudioMDL is required to compile the models. You will need to find a compiled version or build it from the Half-Life 1 SDK.
 
 Once this is done, you may 
 
 * Compile each model individually by giving each  QC file to StudioMDL, or 
 * Use the script "compile_models.bat". 
 
 In order to use the script, you need to register an environment variable named **studiomdl** and give to it the location of StudioMDL.
 
 The output folder containing the compiled models will be "compiled_models".
